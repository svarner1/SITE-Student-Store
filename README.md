## Week 2 Assignment: Student Store

Submitted by: Sydney Varner

Deployed Application (optional): n/a

### Application Features

#### CORE FEATURES

- [ *] The API should contain an endpoint that serves an array of all products in the store
- [* ] A Store model should handle all data management logic for the API and be the interface for read/write operations to the JSON file.
- [ ] The frontend should include a landing page that displays the products available for purchase.
- [ ] Each product should have an individual page that shows the details of the product.

#### STRETCH FEATURES

- [ ] Deploy your website with Heroku & Surge. 
- [ ] An endpoint should exist for creating orders and saving them to a JSON file. Each order should contain the email of the person placing the order, the items associated with the order, and the quantity of each item purchased.
- [ ] There should be a `Sidebar` component that appears on every page and has two states - `open` and `closed`. When the sidebar is opened, it should display a shopping cart of all the products the user currently has in their cart. It should also calculate and display the total amount in dollars for the checked-out items. When it's closed, the sidebar should be much thinner and not display its internal content.
- [ ] A checkout form should be available that allows the user to enter their email and send their order to the API.
- [ ] Create an endpoint for fetching all orders in the database, and an endpoint for serving an individual order based on its id.
- [ ] Create an endpoint that serves only a single product based on the product's id
- [ ] Build a page in the UI that displays the list of all past orders and lets the user click on any individual order to take them to a more detailed page of the transaction.
- [ ] Allow users to use an input to filter orders by the email of the person who placed the order.

### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?
    - I think the labs helped tremendously. If I did not have the labs and the YouTube videos that were included in the daily content in the course portal I would not have accomplished what I have programmed so far.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
    - If I had more time, I would have began the lab a lot earlier in the week. Unfortunately, this week was a little overwhelming for me. There was a lot of dense content that was difficult to grasp in a short time span. I attempted to complete the labs everyday and I ended up not having much time to do the assignment.
    - Yesterday, I spent almost all of my time working on the backend of the project. Instead, I would have began this on Tuesday or Wednesday, so that I could have at least most of Wednesday, all of Thursday, and most of Friday to focus on the UI apect
    - Both portions of the project were pretty difficult for me because I wanted to really make my SITE look like my design. The API and React posed some issues for me.
    - All in all, I am still proud of what I got done. It was a long week of the program and I will spend the rest of the weekend comleting the project in it's entirety.
    - Right now, I don't have the 3rd and 4th requirements done. 

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

    - I think design is definitely a strength of mine, so I did get a few compliments about my wireframe
    - Although, my project is far from completion I made sure to display all that I have including my code.
